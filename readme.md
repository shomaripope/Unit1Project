#Project Description
This Program was created as an alternative to the traditional hangman game, to add a more colorful, less morbid, gaming experience. Who Killed Naruto is about someone in WDI19 developing the tech to travel back in time to make sure the awesomeness of Naruto will never see the light of day, or the future.
